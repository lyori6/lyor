                <p>
                    After gaining experience in the debt collection industry, I recognized that consumers in debt are underserved. Leveraging my knowledge and technical expertise, I founded DebtCat to provide free resources and tools to help consumers improve their financial situation. Our goal is to establish DebtCat as a trusted authority in debt assistance, collaborating with the CFPB and other consumer rights organizations.
